# I know it's very common to do something like:
# 	%sudo ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
# in /etc/sudoers, but that is generally not the approach I like to take.
#
# Where possible, I prefer to scope things more directly. 
# In the sudoers manpage there is a whole extended Backusâ€“Naur form (EBNF)
# grammar that is laid out. There is very flexible functionality for setting up
# things like aliases (which can be comprised of lists), and default overrides.
#
# From sudoers(5):
#
#   User specification
#     User_Spec ::= User_List Host_List '=' Cmnd_Spec_List \
#                   (':' Host_List '=' Cmnd_Spec_List)*
#

# A couple of sample entries for reference consideration:

user1 laptop1 = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/somebinary

user2 workstation2 = NOPASSWD: sha256:9ff0de4810dc60cd3f7710ab89a7d020e3d34cc94a072ba8d1fe3e202a7c74e1 /usr/bin/somecommand

someuser CSNETS = (operator) /usr/local/op_commands/

# Do note the option now (at least in Debian-derived systems) for using 
# @includedir or #includedir directives in the system sudoers file to reference
# another dir like /etc/sudoers.d/ that can contain broken out rules files to be
# parsed individually.

# Something else I found interesting is that sudo seems to just produce a 
# generic-looking "parse error" on STDERR and in system security logs if a 
# Digest is provided but is malformed (like a SHA256 digest != 64 characters).
